# terraform-azurerm-sharepoint

This module is the Terraform version of [this public ARM template](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/templates/sharepoint-adfs/).  
It creates a DC, a SQL Server 2022, and from 1 to 5 server(s) hosting a SharePoint Subscription / 2019 / 2016 farm with an extensive configuration, including trusted authentication, user profiles with personal sites, an OAuth trust (using a certificate), a dedicated IIS site for hosting high-trust add-ins, etc...  
The latest version of key softwares (including Fiddler, vscode, np++, 7zip, ULS Viewer) is installed.  
SharePoint machines have additional fine-tuning to make them immediately usable (remote administration tools, custom policies for Edge and Chrome, shortcuts, etc...).

## Prerequisites

- Access to an Azure subscription.

## Usage

```terraform
module "sharepoint" {
  source                 = "Yvand/sharepoint/azurerm"
  location               = "France Central"
  subscription_id        = "<your_azure_subscription_id>"
  resource_group_name    = "<resource_group_name>"
  sharepoint_version     = "Subscription-Latest"
  admin_username         = "yvand"
  admin_password         = "<password>"
  outbound_access_method = "PublicIPAddress"
  rdp_traffic_rule       = "<your_internet_public_ip>"
}
```

## Features

There are some differences in the configuration, depending on the SharePoint version:

### Common to all SharePoint versions

- An Active Directory forest with AD CS and AD FS configured. LDAPS (LDAP over SSL) is also configured.
- SharePoint service applications configured: User Profiles, add-ins, session state.
- SharePoint User Profiles service is configured with a directory synchronization connection, and the MySite host is a host-named site collection.
- SharePoint has 1 web application with path based and host-named site collections, and contains 2 zones:
  - Default zone: HTTP using Windows authentication.
  - Intranet zone: HTTPS using federated (ADFS) authentication.
- An OAuth trust is created, as well as a custom IIS site to host your high-trust add-ins.
- Custom claims provider [LDAPCP](https://www.ldapcp.com/) is installed and configured.

### Specific to SharePoint Subscription

- SharePoint virtual machines are created using the latest disk image of [Windows Server 2022 Azure Edition](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-server/get-started/editions-comparison-windows-server-2022) available, and SharePoint binaries (install + cumulative updates) are downloaded and installed from scratch.
- The HTTPS site certificate is managed by SharePoint, which has the private key and sets the binding itself in the IIS site.
- Federated authentication with ADFS is configured using OpenID Connect.

### Specific to SharePoint 2019 / 2016

- SharePoint virtual machines are created using a disk image built and maintained by SharePoint Engineering.
- The HTTPS site certificate is positioned by the DSC script.
- Federated authentication with ADFS is configured using SAML 1.1.

## Outbound access to internet

During the provisionning, virtual machines require an outbound access to internet to be able to download and apply their configuration.  
The outbound access method is set by the variable `outbound_access_method`, and can be either of the following:
- `PublicIPAddress`: A [Public IP](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/ip-services/virtual-network-public-ip-address) is associated to each virtual machine's network card.
- `AzureFirewallProxy`: An [Azure Firewall](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/azure-firewall/) service is created and the [explicit proxy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall/explicit-proxy) configured. On the virtual machines, the proxy is set so they can connect to internet through the Azure Firewall's proxy.
  > [!IMPORTANT]  
  > With `AzureFirewallProxy`, you need to either enable Azure Bastion, or manually add a public IP address to a virtual machine, to do a remote desktop connection to it.

## Key variables

### Input variables

- Variable `resource_group_name` is used:
  - As the name of the Azure resource group which hosts all the resources that will be created.
  - As part of the public DNS name of the virtual machines, if a public IP is created (depends on variable `add_public_ip_address`).
- Variable `sharepoint_version` lets you choose which version of SharePoint to install:
  - `Subscription-Latest` (default): Same as `Subscription-RTM`, then installs the latest cumulative update available at the time of publishing this version: September 2024 ([kb5002640](https://support.microsoft.com/help/5002640)).
  - `Subscription-24H2`: Same as `Subscription-RTM`, then installs the [Feature Update 24H2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/what-s-new/new-and-improved-features-in-sharepoint-server-subscription-edition-24h2-release) (September 2024 CU / [kb5002640](https://support.microsoft.com/help/5002640)).
  - `Subscription-24H1`: Same as `Subscription-RTM`, then installs the [Feature Update 24H1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/what-s-new/new-and-improved-features-in-sharepoint-server-subscription-edition-24h1-release) (March 2024 CU / [KB5002564](https://support.microsoft.com/help/5002564)).

  - `2019`: Uses an image built and maintained by SharePoint Engineering, with SharePoint 2019 bits already installed.
  - `2016`: Uses an image built and maintained by SharePoint Engineering, with SharePoint 2016 bits already installed.
- Variables `addPublicIPAddress` and `rdp_traffic_rule`: See [this section](#remote-access-and-security) for detailed information.
- Variable `front_end_servers_count` lets you add up to 4 additional SharePoint servers to the farm with the [MinRole Front-end](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/install/planning-for-a-minrole-server-deployment-in-sharepoint-server).
- Variable `enable_hybrid_benefit_server_licenses` allows you to enable Azure Hybrid Benefit to use your on-premises Windows Server licenses and reduce cost, if you are eligible. See [this page](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/hybrid-use-benefit-licensing) for more information..

### Output variables

The module returns multiple variables to record the logins, passwords and the public IP address of virtual machines.

## Remote access and security

The template creates 1 virtual network with 3 subnets (+1 if [Azure Bastion](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/azure-bastion/) is enabled), and each subnet is protected by a [Network Security Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview) which denies all incoming traffic by default.  
The following variables configure how to connect to the virtual machines, and the level of network security:

- Variables `admin_password` and `other_accounts_password` require a [strong password](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/faq#what-are-the-password-requirements-when-creating-a-vm-) with **at least 8 characters**, or they can be left empty to use an auto-generated password that will be recorded in the state file.
- Variable `addPublicIPAddress`:
  - if `"SharePointVMsOnly"` (default): Only SharePoint virtual machines get a public IP address with a DNS name and can be reached from Internet.
  - If `"Yes"`: All virtual machines get a public IP address with a DNS name, and can be reached from Internet.
  - if `"No"`: No public IP resource is created.
  - The DNS name format of virtual machines is `"[resource_group_name]-[vm_name].[region].cloudapp.azure.com"` and is recorded as output in the state file.
- Variable `rdp_traffic_rule` specifies if RDP traffic is allowed:
  - If `"No"` (default): Firewall denies all incoming RDP traffic.
  - If `"*"` or `"Internet"`: Firewall accepts all incoming RDP traffic from Internet (very, very much not recommended) (but hey you are the boss).
  - If CIDR notation (e.g. `"192.168.99.0/24"` or `"2001:1234::/64"`) or IP address (e.g. `"192.168.99.0"` or `"2001:1234::"`): Firewall accepts incoming RDP traffic from the IP addresses specified.
- Variable `enable_azure_bastion`:
  - if `true`: Configure service [Azure Bastion](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/azure-bastion/) to allow a secure remote access to virtual machines.
  - if `false` (default): Service [Azure Bastion](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/azure-bastion/) is not created.

## Cost of the resources deployed

By default, virtual machines use [B-series burstable](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/sizes-b-series-burstable), ideal for such template and much cheaper than other comparable series.  
Here is the default size and storage type per virtual machine role:

- DC: Size [Standard_B2s](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/sizes-b-series-burstable) (2 vCPU / 4 GiB RAM) and OS disk is a 32 GiB [standard SSD E4](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/disks-types#standard-ssds).
- SQL Server: Size [Standard_B2ms](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/sizes-b-series-burstable) (2 vCPU / 8 GiB RAM) and OS disk is a 128 GiB [standard SSD E10](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/disks-types#standard-ssds).
- SharePoint: Size [Standard_B4ms](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/sizes-b-series-burstable) (4 vCPU / 16 GiB RAM) and OS disk is either a 32 GiB [standard SSD E4](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/disks-types#standard-ssds) (for SharePoint Subscription and 2019), or a 128 GiB [standard SSD E10](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/disks-types#standard-ssds) (for SharePoint 2016).

You can visit <https://azure.com/e/c494029b0b034b8ca356c926dfd2688a> to estimate the monthly cost of the template in the region/currency of your choice, assuming it is created using the default settings and runs 24*7.

## Known issues

- The password for the User Profile directory synchronization connection (value of parameter `other_accounts_password`) needs to be re-entered in the "Edit synchronization connection" page, otherwise the import fails (password decryption error).

## More information

Additional notes:

- Using the default options, the complete deployment takes about 1h (but it is worth it).
- Deploying any post-RTM SharePoint Subscription build adds only an extra 5-10 minutes to the total deployment time (compared to RTM), partly because the updates are installed before the farm is created.
- Once it is completed, the template will return valuable information in the 'Outputs' of the deployment.
- For various (very good) reasons, in SQL and SharePoint VMs, the name of the local (not domain) administrator is in format `"l-[admin_username]"`. It is recorded in the 'Outputs' and in the state file.
